# **AI-Concepts-From-Scratch**  

## 🚀 Introduction  
This repository contains implementations of fundamental AI and deep learning concepts from scratch, without relying on high-level libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or even NumPy. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of the core mathematics and logic behind these algorithms by building them from the ground up.  

## 📌 Why Implement AI Concepts from Scratch?  
Implementing AI algorithms from scratch provides several key benefits:  

- **Deep Understanding** – Writing the code yourself helps you grasp the underlying mathematics and logic.  
- **Debugging and Optimization** – Enables you to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance efficiently.  
- **No Library Dependency** – Gain flexibility by not relying on black-box implementations.  
- **Interview Preparation** – Strengthens problem-solving skills essential for AI/ML job interviews.  

## 🔥 Implemented Concepts  
✅ **Intersection over Union (IoU)** – A metric used to evaluate the overlap between two bounding boxes. [View Implementation](https://github.com/mohamed-ehab415/IOU_from_scarth/blob/main/IOU%20from%20scratsh.py)  

✅ **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)** – A technique used in object detection to remove redundant bounding boxes. [View Implementation](https://github.com/mohamed-ehab415/IOU_from_scarth/blob/main/Non%20Max%20Suppression.py)  



✅ **mean_average_precision (MAP)** – sed to evaluate object detection models by measuring how well predicted bounding boxes match the ground truth.. [View Implementation](https://github.com/mohamed-ehab415/AI-Concepts-From-Scratch/blob/main/Mean%20Average%20Precision.py)  

✅ **Multi-Head Attention** – A core component of the Transformer architecture that enables the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence in parallel. [🔍 View Implementation](https://github.com/mohamed-ehab415/AI-Concepts-From-Scratch/blob/main/multi-head-att.py)

✅ **Simple RNN** – A basic Recurrent Neural Network implementation that maintains a hidden state across time steps to process sequential data.  
[View Implementation](https://github.com/mohamed-ehab415/AI-Concepts-From-Scratch/blob/main/Simple_RNN_Pyton.py)

✅ **Cross-Attention** – A mechanism that allows a target sequence to attend to a source sequence, essential in encoder-decoder architectures for tasks like machine translation and image captioning. [View Implementation](https://github.com/mohamed-ehab415/AI-Concepts-From-Scratch/blob/main/cross_attention.py)

✅ **Multi-Class Object Detector** – Detects multiple classes in an image with bounding box regression. Combines **CrossEntropyLoss** for classification and **MSELoss** for bounding boxes using a ResNet50 backbone.
