# AI Concepts From Scratch

## üöÄ Introduction  
This repository contains implementations of fundamental AI and deep learning concepts, focusing on understanding the core mathematics and logic behind modern machine learning algorithms. Each implementation is designed to provide clarity on how these concepts work under the hood.

## üìå Why Implement AI Concepts From Scratch?  
Building AI algorithms from the ground up offers several advantages:  
- **Deep Understanding** ‚Äì Gain insight into the underlying mathematics and algorithmic logic  
- **Debugging & Optimization** ‚Äì Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize implementations effectively  
- **Foundation Building** ‚Äì Develop a strong theoretical and practical foundation in AI/ML  
- **Interview Preparation** ‚Äì Strengthen problem-solving skills essential for technical interviews
